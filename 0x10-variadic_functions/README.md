he va_list is a type to hold the information needed by va_start, va_arg, and va_end. We declare a va_list type variable args.

va_start(args, n) is called before accessing the variable arguments. It initializes args to store the additional arguments after n.

The loop runs n times, each time using va_arg(args, int) to get the next argument as an integer. These integers are added to the sum.

Finally, va_end(args) is called to clean up the memory assigned to args. This is important to prevent memory leaks.

After all the numbers have been added together, the function returns the sum.
