The malloc function is used to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution of a program. It will request a block of memory from the heap. If the request is granted, the operating system will reserve the requested amount of memory and malloc will return a pointer to the reserved space.
The free function frees the memory space which have been allocated by a previous call to malloc (or calloc, or realloc).
When writing big and complex programs, it is not always easy to keep track of all allocated and deallocated memory. We can use the program Valgrind in order to ensure we are freeing all allocated memory. It is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling.
